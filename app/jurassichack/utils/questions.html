    <p>You sit down at your workstation, and a message flashes across the screen:</p>
    
    <p><strong>Task 1:</strong> The park’s systems are built on vast amounts of data. Before we can reveal more, we need to see if you can handle the basics.</p>
    
    <p>Add up the 1000 integers stored in the input file at the link below. Once done, <strong>stand up, walk across the room to the terminal, and enter your answer.</strong> You’ll need to <strong>return to your workstation and refresh the screen</strong> to continue.</p>
